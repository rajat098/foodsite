          Customers can order very quickly or can take a very long time to decide. No longer an issue for you. Switching the focus from offline ordering to online ordering means less hassle on handling undecided calling clients and the staff time lost in the process. And if you do it like a pro, you can eliminate even the follow up calls. With an ordering system like ours, the order confirmation is received by the client in real time, so there is no reason for you to call back.

              Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hindu, and cultural choices and traditions.
